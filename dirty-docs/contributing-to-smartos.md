Other Contributions
=======================

Not a coder? There are still plenty of ways you can help out, such as:

- documentation here on the wiki
- blog posts with details and how to's about what you're doing with
    SmartOS ("SmartOS is awesome!" is nice to hear, but a little more
    information about why you think that is preferable) - make sure
    [Deirdr√©](mailto:smartos@joyent.com) knows about it!
- answer questions and participate in constructive discussion on [irc
    and/or the mailing
    lists](Mailing%20Lists%20and%20IRC.html "Mailing Lists and IRC")
- organize SmartOS/illumos events near you, or help us spread the word
    by getting speakers to events such as local meetups. If you want to
    present something yourself, we can help with slides etc.
