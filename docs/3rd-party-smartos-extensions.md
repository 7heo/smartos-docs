# 3rd Party SmartOS Extensions

The broader SmartOS community has put together extensions to the SmartOS
core to enable additional and different functionality. While encouraged,
these are not supported by Joyent. If you have any issues with these,
please contact the folks who maintain them.

## Additional Software Repositories

repositories. For more information on using it and getting started,
[read the instructions](3rd-party-software-repos.md).

## Additional KVM features

[Read on](spice-on-smartos.md) for more information on how to get started.

## Additional Management Tools
