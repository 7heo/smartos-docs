# dtrace.conf

DTrace.conf is a quadriennial(?) one-day, one-track conference about DTrace.
Past events have been held in 2008, 2012, and 2016. If this trend continues,
we'll see you in 2020!

## DTrace.conf 2012

The original dtrace.conf in 2008 was a smash hit -- even the
[analysts were raving](http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2008/03/16/dtraceconf-and-the-dumbest-guy-in-the-room/)!
In pace with the Olympiad, it's time once again to bring the community
together for dtrace.conf 2012! This Joyent-sponsored community event
will be held on Tuesday, April 3rd **at the
[Children's Creativity Museum](http://creativity.org/),
4th and Howard (entrance behind the carousel) in downtown San Francisco**.

As with the inaugural dtrace.conf, this will be a technical conference
for people who are using DTrace, expanding its boundaries, and
contributing to its growth and health. If you're ready to talk about
what you found in technical detail – and how DTrace helped you (or
didn't!) – we would love for you to join us at dtrace.conf.

A few short, rough video clips from the 2008 edition are
[here](http://smartos.org/2012/02/10/dtrace-conf-2012/).

The 2012 edition will be streamed live. Sign up on
[the UStream channel](http://www.ustream.tv/channel/dtrace-conf) to be
reminded before the stream starts.

### Speaker Info

**Remember: If you're in the room, you're potentially a speaker.** This
will be done in unconference style, so every attendee should come
prepared to present or otherwise lead a discussion or session of **about
45 minutes**. Note that "just using DTrace" is more than sufficient for
leading a discussion or session.

Equipment available:

- projector
- NO whiteboard
