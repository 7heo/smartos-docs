# Mailing Lists and IRC

There are several ways to connect with the SmartOS and Illumos
communities.

## Mailing Lists

The best place to talk about SmartOS is the [smartos-discuss mailing
list](https://smartos.topicbox.com/groups/smartos-discuss). If you wish
to send mail to the list you'll need to join, but you can view and
search the archives online without being a member. The discussion list
is the best way to find a broad range of people who may be working on
the same problems or have answered the same questions you have.

There are also other related mailing lists for software included in, or
related to, SmartOS; e.g.,

- [illumos Mailing Lists](https://illumos.org/docs/community/lists/)
- [Joyent Triton](https://smartdatacenter.topicbox.com/groups/sdc-discuss)
  (Compute Service built on SmartOS)
- [Joyent Manta](https://mantastorage.topicbox.com/groups/manta-discuss)
  (Object Storage built on SmartOS)

## IRC

IRC is a great place to interact in real time with other SmartOS users,
and (perhaps) get quick answers to questions when you're in the middle
of something and need advice.

We can be found in the following channels on freenode.net:

- `#smartos`: The Official SmartOS/Triton Channel
  ([Channel Logs](http://echelog.com/logs/browse/smartos))
- `#manta`: The Official Manta Channel
  ([Channel Logs](http://echelog.com/logs/browse/manta))
- `#illumos`: For discussion of the Illumos project and its
  distributions ([Channel Logs](http://echelog.com/logs/browse/illumos))
- `#joyent`: People often find us here, but `#smartos` is preferred.
